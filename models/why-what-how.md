#### Why -  What - How 

That's a model I came up with, trying to understand the first principles of any work needs to be done.

### In short
> Why? (Values) →   What? (Vision of the outcome) → How? (Implementation details)


### Some longer version

In the beginning there's a pain a person has. (Something, that damages values `Why`)

There's some interpretation of that pain by this person( sympthoms → root causes)

There's some interpretation of that pain by some solution offerer(some service / company)

There's some vision of the solution of that pain. (`What`)

There's some vison of how that solution can be made. ( `How` )

There's some instance of that solution in the real world. ( Implementation itself)
